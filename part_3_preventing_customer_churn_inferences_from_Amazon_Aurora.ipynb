    "Now we have the ability to detect, during a customer interaction, whether this is an \"at-risk\" customer, and to intervene - to provide them with an incentive to stay. We can choose the factors on which we want to base our response: the sentiment of this interaction, combined with the customer's current characteristics, interaction history, and estimated risk. We can randomize our responses, too, in order to begin to gather more data on what effective incentives are. \n",

    "We can now begin to add experimentation and nuance to our incentive program:\n",

    "* At the time the incentive is offered, we can record the customer's sentiment, churn prediction at this time, the current value of key drivers, and the incentive offered.\n",
    "* We can randomize the incentives offered, in order to perform \"A/B\" testing of different incentives to customers with similar characteristics.\n",
    "* We can experiment with different kinds of incentives, beyond the simple dollar rebate in our sample: new telephones, plan upgrades, and so on. \n",
    "* We can later analyze the incentives offered and the results achieved by those incentives. How much of an incentive must we offer to which kinds of customers to reduce churn? How much is retaining that customer worth to us, versus the cost of the incentive?\n",
    "* We can add economic analysis. How much is it worth to keep this customer? What's the optimal threshold score to maximize profit?\n",
